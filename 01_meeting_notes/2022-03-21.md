## Discussion Notes 

This meeting began by getting to know our neighbours. We spoke about our most/least favourite undergraduate models. We then moved onto Git, introducing the concept of committing, pulling and pushing with [Github](https://github.com/) and locally via the terminal. We completed many tasks, with complexity increasing as time went on.
