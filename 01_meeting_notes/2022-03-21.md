## Agenda 

1. Get to know one another
2. Discuss project expectations
3. Reminder of key dates


## Discussion Notes 

This meeting began by getting to know our neighbours. We spoke about our most/least favourite undergraduate models. We then moved onto Git, introducing the concept of committing, pulling and pushing with [Github](https://github.com/) and locally via the terminal. We completed many tasks, with complexity increasing as time went on. 

## Key points

- Statisticians do **not** like real analysis, of any kind. 
- You can commit changes to a repo either locally, or directly onto [Github](https://github.com/).
- If you name a repo with your username, it's README.md appears in your profile. 
- Zak likes to forget to change directory before adding changes.


## ToDos

1. Work on a more complicated git project.
2. Implement Zak's file storage method via git. 
3. Complete meeting notes for session 1.
